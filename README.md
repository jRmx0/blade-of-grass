# Blade of Grass

An open source **robotic lawn mower** project: the mower, a cloud server it talks to, and a client app to watch and control it.

This is the **meta repository**. The project lives on GitHub:

- **[Wiki](https://github.com/rmx-lt/blade-of-grass/wiki)**: overview, architecture, and the docs of every component (server, backend probe, modem probe).
- **[Project board](https://github.com/orgs/rmx-lt/projects/1)**: what is done, in progress, next and planned, as issues across all repos.

## Repos
